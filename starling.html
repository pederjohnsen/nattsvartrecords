    <h1>Information for Starling application</h1>
    <h2>Details on the countries we operate within/trade with</h2>
    <p>
      We operate within the UK and will sell our products worldwide (except for
      countries where restrictions apply with our delivery partners).
    </p>
    <p>So far we've only sold to customer in these European countries:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Germany</li>
      <li>Uruguay</li>
      <li>Norway</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Handling of international transfers</h2>
    <p>
      All sales are processed in GBP (£) via our payment partners Stripe and
      Paypal. So we don't expect any international transfers hitting our
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for sending money, we usually pay our non UK suppliers via PayPal letting PayPal handle the currency exchange.
      However we are not expecting any payments to be sent to our international suppliers in the next 12 months as of now, but if this changes, it is likely any transfers would total less than £1,000 and would all go to Edisco in Portugal.
    </p>

    <h2>Revenue from online streaming/royalties/podcasts</h2>
    <p>
      We only release physical products (vinyl, cassettes, CDs) and bands retain
      full copyright and ownership of their music. We do not handle any
      streaming or royalties for our bands or take any cut of their streaming
      revenue.
    </p>

    <h2>Clients/suppliers</h2>
    <p>
      We don't yet have any clients and only release music from bands we play
      in. When we eventually do expand and start taking on bands, we will likely
      work with bands mostly from the UK and Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have only worked with a handfull of suppliers so far, most of which are based in the UK
